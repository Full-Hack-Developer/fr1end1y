This solution was generated with _fr1end1y_, a website starter kit that combines [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/), _"the friendly CMS"_, with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), _"a simpler static site generator"_.

## âž¡ [Documentation](https://fr1end1y.fullhack.dev/docs/)

- [fr1end1y on GitHub](https://github.com/Full-Hack-Developer/fr1end1y)
- [fr1end1y on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.Templates.Fr1end1y)

## Getting Started

### Install Umbraco

Run the following command in this directory to launch the CMS:

```sh
npm run dev-cms
```

Open <https://localhost:11111> in your web browser and follow the instructions to install Umbraco.

Log in to Umbraco and check that the demo content has been imported and is published.

### Run Eleventy

With the CMS still running, in a new terminal run the following command to launch the front end site:

```sh
npm run dev-site
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> in your web browser and hopefully you will see the docs site!
